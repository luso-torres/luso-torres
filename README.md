## Signal Processing 📡🎛️
### [Image Classifier applying Stochastic Class Discrimination](https://github.com/luso-torres/imageProcessing)
- **Description**: ML Classifier algorithm for images. Class discrimination utilizes Naïve Bayes, Linear, and Quadratic discriminators.
- **Tools Used**: Python (scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib), JupyterLab, Docker.

### [Spatial and Frequency Filtering on Images for Computer Vision](https://github.com/luso-torres/spatial-frequency-filtering)
- **Description**: The project implements spatial and frequency filtering for feature extraction and image classification using Computer Vision with reduced dimensions.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Jupyter Notebooks.

## FEM and Numerical Simulations 📐🖥️
### [Numerical Simulation of a Supersonic Diffuser and Nozzle in a Jet Engine](https://github.com/luso-torres/supersonic-flow)
- **Description**: This project aimed to validate the optimal geometries derived from the analytical calculations of the diffuser and nozzle on their inviscid and viscous behavior.
- **Tools Used**: ANSYS Fluent, MATLAB, CATIA, ANSYS Workbench, mkdocs, LaTeX.


### [Heat Transfer of a Structural Finn by Conduction and Convection](https://github.com/luso-torres/HeatTransfer)
- **Description**: This project aimed to evaluate the CVFEM finite element method. Algorithms developed for mesh generation, discretization of partial differential equations and evaluation of heat transfer.
- **Tools Used**: mkdocs, LaTeX, MATLAB.📡🎛️


### [Heat Transfer Through Crossflow on Cylindrical Tubes](https://github.com/luso-torres/HeatConvection)
- **Description**: This project aimed to investigate numerically the heat transfer due to a crossflow over a series of circular tubes arranged in rows. The analysis utilized the transient CVFEM method.
- **Tools Used**: mkdocs, LaTeX, MATLAB.
